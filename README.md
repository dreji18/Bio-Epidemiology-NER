## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Bio-Epidemiology-NER

```bash
pip install Bio-Epidemiology-NER
```

This package has dependency over Pytorch, please install the required configuration from this link https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

## Usage

## NER with Bio-Epidemiology-NER
```python
# load all the functions
from Bio_Epidemiology_NER.bio_recognizer import ner_prediction

# returns the predicted class along with the probability of the actual EnvBert model
doc = """
	CASE: A 28-year-old previously healthy man presented with a 6-week history of palpitations. 
      The symptoms occurred during rest, 2â€“3 times per week, lasted up to 30 minutes at a time 
      and were associated with dyspnea. Except for a grade 2/6 holosystolic tricuspid regurgitation 
      murmur (best heard at the left sternal border with inspiratory accentuation), physical 
      examination yielded unremarkable findings.
      """

# returns a dataframe output
ner_prediction(corpus=doc, compute='cpu') #pass compute='gpu' if using gpu

```

## Annotate the entities in a Medical Report and export as pdf/csv format 
```python
# load all the functions
from Bio_Epidemiology_NER.bio_recognizer import pdf_annotate

# enter pdf file name
pdffile = 'Alhashash-2020-Emergency surgical management.pdf'

# returns a annotated pdf file
pdf_annotate(pdffile,compute='cpu', output_format='pdf') #pass compute='gpu' if using gpu

# returns a csv file with entities
pdf_annotate(pdffile,compute='cpu', output_format='csv') #pass compute='gpu' if using gpu

# return both annotated pdf and csv file
pdf_annotate(pdffile,compute='cpu', output_format='all') #pass compute='gpu' if using gpu

```


## About the Model
The model within this package is an English Named Entity Recognition model, trained on Maccrobat to recognize the bio-medical entities (84 entities) from a given text corpus (case reports etc.). This model was built on top of distilbert-base-uncased

- Dataset : Maccrobat https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/MACCROBAT2018/9764942
- Carbon emission : 0.0279399890043426 Kg
- Training time : 30.16527 minute
- GPU used : 1 x GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU
